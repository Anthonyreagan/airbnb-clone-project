# AirBnB Clone Project

## Project Overview
A full-stack clone of AirBnB focusing on backend architecture, database design, and user interactions.  
**Goal:** Build a functional MVP with user authentication, property listings, and booking systems.

## Team Roles
| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|-----------------|
| Backend Developer | Implement server logic, API endpoints, and database interactions |
| Database Administrator | Design and optimize database schema, ensure data integrity |
| Frontend Developer | Build user interfaces (if applicable) |
| DevOps Engineer | Set up CI/CD pipelines, deployment infrastructure |
| QA Engineer | Test functionality and ensure bug-free releases |

## Technology Stack
| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Django (Python) | Backend web framework for building RESTful APIs |
| PostgreSQL | Relational database for structured data storage |
| GraphQL | Alternative API query language for efficient data fetching |
| Docker | Containerization for consistent development environments |
| AWS (EC2/S3) | Cloud hosting and file storage |
| Redis | Caching for improved performance |

## Database Design
### Key Entities:
1. **Users**
   - Fields: `id`, `email`, `password_hash`, `first_name`, `last_name`
   - Relations: One-to-many with Properties, Bookings

2. **Properties**
   - Fields: `id`, `title`, `description`, `price`, `owner_id` (FK to Users)
   - Relations: Many-to-one with Users, One-to-many with Bookings

3. **Bookings**
   - Fields: `id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `property_id` (FK), `user_id` (FK)
   - Relations: Many-to-one with Users and Properties

4. **Reviews**
   - Fields: `id`, `content`, `rating`, `property_id` (FK), `author_id` (FK)
   - Relations: Many-to-one with Users and Properties

## Feature Breakdown
1. **User Management**
   - Registration, login, and profile management
   - Ensures secure access to platform features

2. **Property Management**
   - Create, read, update, delete property listings
   - Core functionality for hosts to manage offerings

3. **Booking System**
   - Date selection, availability checking, reservation processing
   - Main transactional feature for guests

4. **Review System**
   - Rating and feedback for properties
   - Builds trust within the community

## API Security
1. **Authentication**
   - JWT tokens for user sessions
   - Protects against unauthorized access

2. **Authorization**
   - Role-based access control (e.g., hosts vs guests)
   - Ensures users only access permitted resources

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Throttle API requests per user
   - Prevents abuse and DDoS attacks

4. **Data Validation**
   - Input sanitization for all endpoints
   - Protects against SQL injection and XSS

## CI/CD Pipeline
1. **Continuous Integration**
   - Automated testing on every commit (GitHub Actions)
   - Ensures code quality before merging

2. **Continuous Deployment**
   - Docker containers for consistent environments
   - Automated deployment to AWS on successful builds

3. **Monitoring**
   - Logging and error tracking
   - Quick identification of production issues
